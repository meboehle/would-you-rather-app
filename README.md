## Would You Rather App

#### Running the application:
1. Clone the would-you-rather-app project and switch to the directory
2. Run npm install
3. Run npm start
4. Open browser at localhost:3000

#### Description:
This is an application that allows users to answer 'Would You Rather?' questions posed by themselves and other users. To begin, a user must first select a 'user' to login. Once logged in, a list of the currently logged in user's unanswered and answered questions are displayed on the main dashboard. The user can toggle between their unanswered and answered questions.

The user can navigate to a question's details to either vote or view the votes (depending on whether it has been answered or not). The user can also add new questions and view a leaderboard that displays users in descending order of who has asked and answered the most questions. If the user tries to navigate to a route that does not exist or to a question that does not exist, they will be shown a 404 page
